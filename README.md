# PersonalityQuiz

This little game tells you what animal you are after answering three questions. The questions are all of a different type: single answer, multiple answers, and a ranged answer. Each answer indicates a different animal (dog, cat, turtle, or rabbit). When you finished the questions, the app calculates which animal was indicated the most of the time by your answers. You'll see the result with a little description.
